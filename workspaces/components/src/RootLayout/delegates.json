For the past 6 months, we have been actively involved in the StarkNet ecosystem. During this time, we have successfully built a close-knit community in Vietnam and have contributed to the growth and development of the network through various activities such as participating in community forums and discussions, writing articles or blog posts about StarkNet, and organizing meetups or events. We are now seeking to become a delegate of the StarkNet Governance.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why do you want to be a delegate? How do you plan to fulfill this role?</strong></p><p>We are interested in joining the StarkNet governance team because we support the goals of building a decentralized, sustainable ecosystem that benefits all stakeholders. As a member of the governance team, we hope to contribute to the growth and development of the network through active participation in discussions and decision-making, promoting transparency and accountability, and educating the Vietnamese community about StarkNet and its values. We also want to help create a supportive, informed community where there is no room for unethical behavior such as seedings, shillings, and where we are not just a group of investors and degens, but also a community of builders and developers. To that end, we plan to work with universities in the area to encourage developers from other languages to adopt Cairo, and with the support of the StarkWare team, we hope to incubate and educate developers so that they can build real products on StarkNet and contribute to the ecosystem.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Please list and explain the core values that will guide your decision-making</strong></p><ul><li>Decentralization: We believe in the power of decentralization to create a more fair and equitable society, and will prioritize decisions that support the decentralization of the StarkNet ecosystem.</li><li>Transparency: We believe that transparency is essential for building trust and accountability within the community, and will prioritize decisions that promote transparency in governance and decision-making.</li><li>Sustainability: We believe that the long-term success of StarkNet depends on its ability to be financially and environmentally sustainable, and will prioritize decisions that support the sustainability of the network.</li><li>Security: We believe that the security of the StarkNet network is of the utmost importance, and will prioritize decisions that enhance the security of the network.</li><li>Education: We believe that education is crucial for the growth and development of the StarkNet ecosystem, and will prioritize decisions that support education and knowledge-sharing within the community.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Why should someone delegate to you?

We have a proven track record of contributions to the ecosystem and a deep understanding of the principles and values that guide the network. We are willing to take on the responsibilities of a delegate and are committed to fostering transparency, accountability, and engagement with the community. We are also open to diverse perspectives and are dedicated to educating and sharing knowledge with fellow users in the Vietnamese community. In our decision-making, we will prioritize these values and work towards the growth and development of the StarkNet network.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Please provide your skills and areas of expertise</strong></p><p>As a team, we have diverse areas of expertise, with a focus on DeFi, NFTs, and cryptocurrency. We are dedicated to staying current in these rapidly evolving industries by learning about new trends and technologies, and participating in educational programs and events. Additionally, we have a strong background in creating and curating digital content, including writing blog posts, creating social media posts, designing infographics, and producing video content. Our extensive networks in Vietnam and our organizational skills also enable us to effectively communicate complex information in an engaging and understandable way. These strengths make me, as a voice of the StarkNet Vietnam community, well-suited to serve as a delegate in StarkNet Governance.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Please provide any potential conflicts of interest with your participation in StarkNet governance as a delegate.</strong></p><p>At the moment, I do not have any conflicts of interest that I am aware of, but I will make sure to disclose any that arise during the delegation process.

    "statement": "<p>Hi everyone. I’m Nathan, the ecosystem lead at Snapshot Labs. With this candidacy, I aim to represent both myself and Snapshot, so I’ll introduce both.</p><p>I’m a political philosophy researcher with a strong interest in blockchains and the governance of decentralized networks. I worked previously around the topic of limiting the influence of Big Tech on the internet and that research brought me here, as I believe that the early stage of governance on decentralized networks is crucial to turning the centralization of power in the digital space. I’ve been working at Snapshot as the ecosystem lead to try to guide the organization toward that vision. I’ve quickly taken interest in StarkNet, as we announced our cooperation on Snapshot X, a fully on-chain voting framework, and have since then organized two meetups in Brussels attended by dozens of enthusiasts as well as companies like Argent, Ledger, StarkWare, or the chads at Briq.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Values</strong></p><p>Snapshot itself is the home of governance for a vast majority of DAOs. Around summer 2021, we decided to make the same bet as many of you here, that ZK Rollups were the future of blockchain, and that StarkWare had the best shot to deliver on that vision. Since then, our team has been very active in the StarkNet ecosystem creating key infrastructure pieces including&nbsp;<a href=\"https://checkpoint.fyi/#/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: var(--tertiary);\">Checkpoint</a>, contributions to storage proofs, native Ethereum signatures, and contributions on Pathfinder.</p><p>Our vision for Snapshot X is an unstoppable set of governance smart contracts that any DAO, community or even political entity can use for free in order to create a basis for fair governance. For that reason, we need StarkNet to be as decentralized and secure as possible. As a delegate, this will be the core value I’ll be representing.</p><p>We have strong experience in DAO governance, not simply by being the platform where most of it happens. We’ve been active delegates in the ENS DAO, the Safe DAO, and the Optimism token house. In all of these, we’ve promoted the values of ecosystem growth, fairness, and progressive decentralization.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Conflicts of interest</strong></p><p>StarkNet’s governance will happen on Snapshot, and then Snapshot X. We don’t believe that this creates a conflict of interest though, as we are even more strongly incentivized to see it succeed. It however could cause us to promote Snapshot over other governance frameworks.</p>",

I am a content creator and dev facilitator in StarkNet ecosystem. Before I am in StarkNet, I have worked as a writer and contributor to ChainNews, which was one of the biggest crypto media outlet but shut down in late 2020 due to regulation. Since the founding of SCC ten months ago, I have led to create and translate the best and the most reliable content covering StarkNet ecosystem for Chinese speaking crypto fans, developers and investors. SCC is dedicated to the development of StarkNet for Chinese speaking readers. Our mission is to increase the awareness of StarkNet, L2 and crypto, serve for users and onboard more developers.</p><p>I am glad to apply for delegate so that I could help to speak for Chinese-speaking community and grow awareness of StarkNet in SEA. Although this is the fisrt time in StarkNet to directly involve myself in governance, I have been active in several crypto communities participating the community building. I am experienced in content creation, education, and onboarding new users.</p><p>Through crypto I entered a new world. I learnt everything in finance, opensource software, and blockchain all by myself. I stepped in distributed technology by attending the course in edX taught by Linux Foundation years ago. Since then my new journey begins.</p><p>By growing in a country with political polarization, I have a strong sense how centralized power would have impacts on individuals. Thus I believe in the values blockchain would bring into the world: decentralization, transparency, inclusiveness, privacy and self-sovereign. All these will be cornerstones of humanity in the information age.</p><p>I will be a delegate committed to the development of StarkNet, Cairo and the technology of validity proof behind it. I feel its my mission to bridge Chinese speaking community with the world.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Conflicts of Interest</strong></p><p>Since I started StarkNet Chinese Community, I have been working on content creation, doing education, and onboarding devs on StarkNet. I will declare the conflicts of interest if any in the future.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Requests of Delegators</strong></p><p>If you have any questions on us, please feel free to contact me.</p><p>https://t.me/leoyoung0</p>",

In case it would be considered right by the foundation and the council, I could find ways to make my community play an active part of my voting decision that would always be aimed at making StarkNet a solid and community centric network.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t have direct experience about DAO Governance but I’m knowledgeable about its concept and its role having intensely experienced the period when such concept was born and DAOs principles started being adopted more and more. Although it would be my first direct Governance Experience, I’m aware of the responsibility and of the duties that such a role implies.</p><p><br></p><p>My skills and areas of expertise are the ones that characterize Content Creation and Educational/fundamental-driven promotional content with the goal of turning complex concepts into easy to understand words. Although I’m not a very technical figure, three years ago I fully attended a Pathcourse to become a Solidity Dev from scratch and, on top of this experience, I had been studying/analyzing a lot about Blockchain technicalities.</p><p><br></p><p>Delegates should choose me as a Delegator as they would have a very active Community Member that will try his best to make them feel an active part of the StarkNet Governance process.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Conflicts of Interest</strong></p><p>I create Content about the StarkNet Ecosystem and I’ve been receiving support in terms of sponsorizations, partnerships and grants in order to make such content sustainable in the future for both me and the ecosystem. I remain at disposition to disclose my Business agreements with the Foundation and the council before and during the length of the delegation.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Requests for Delegators?</strong></p><p>We could have AMA Spaces to discuss the Governance Process together.

Using STARKs, as well as the native innovations, StarkNet will allow dApps to achieve unlimited scale at a fraction of the cost.</p><p>StarkNets native account abstraction will enable a more seamless experience within crypto ranging from social recovery, session keys, and batch operations, amongst others, for interacting with DeFi, Games, and Web3. This will introduce a much-needed improved UX and contribute to onboarding the next millions of users.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>How do we work?</strong></p><ul><li>At Stable Node, we have a team of governance analysts constantly researching and participating in the DeFi space.</li><li>This allows us to keep our skills and knowledge up to date so we can make informed decisions. Additionally, our team is able to use the knowledge to brainstorm new experimental ideas and innovations regarding governance, keeping our team to be on the leading edge of governance.</li><li>Finally, we make it a point to build relationships with the community and core team for each protocol we work in to ensure we are meeting the needs of each protocol. We hope to use our research, new ideas, and personal connections to help StarkNet achieve its goals.</li></ul><p><br></p>",

    "statement": "Prior to my web3 experience, I created a non-profit called Les Ravitailleurs that cooked meals for people in need during the confinements. We onboarded hundreds of volunteers and our chefs cooked 100k+ meals that were distributed for free. Before knowing about any of the web3 good practices, I spontaneously created a decentralized governance for the non-profit. Everyone was able to propose improvements, every discussion was public and every decision was made by the group. When I entered the web3 ecosystem, I discovered a way to scale this approach. I first launched Pxls: an art project in which there is no centralized decision. The result of an artwork depends on the ability of the community to coordinate with very little communication. I believe in democracy, horizontal decision making and decentralization. My past experience show that I care deeply about how to make good decisions together and that’s why I believe I could be a valuable delegate. But decentralization and horizontality also have drawbacks: it creates inefficiencies and useless discussions sometimes. That’s why  I’ll also be here to remind people that the value is in the execution, not only in the discussion..",

Specifically, I plan to focus on utilizing my experience to review and vote on network upgrades and feature prioritization, as well as thoroughly engaging with the community to gather feedback and perspectives.</p><p>Probably have a small ulterior motive of putting StarkNet’s name as the “gaming chain”<img ../=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smile.png?v=12\" alt=\":smile:\" height=\"20\" width=\"20\">; yall sleeping on Cartridge.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>My Core Values</strong></p><p>As a delegate my core values will be transparency, accountability, and a commitment to the long-term success of the network. My priorities would be sustainable decentralization and community growth (+++ maintaining a healthy mix of builders &amp; end users). I will ensure my best that I guide my decisions consistently with these.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Experience, Skills, Interest, and Expertise</strong></p><p>My main interest over the past year or so has revolved around on-chain gaming, and extends somewhat to not-so-on-chain gaming but still gaming with stuff on-chain. Was heavily involved in the Parallel (the trading card game) community; deploying community utility stuff i.e. the cards dashboard, check it out if you’d like:</p><p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14lg8p_ODvPtBfeTQCCU7--rks0GKruHtcPkhlnBEFu8/edit#gid=1104248591\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: var(--tertiary);\">Parallel Alpha Dashboard - Google Sheets&nbsp;</a><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14lg8p_ODvPtBfeTQCCU7--rks0GKruHtcPkhlnBEFu8/edit#gid=1104248591\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: var(--primary-medium); background-color: var(--primary-low);\">4</a>.</p><p>I’ve been bringing the same energy towards gaming projects I’ve encountered on StarkNet (shout-out Cartridge, Frenslands, Realms!) and cannot wait to foster like-minded people, and users onto the network.</p><p>Currently heads down on deploying the first&nbsp;<em>fingers-crossed</em>&nbsp;StarkNet’s first omnichain NFT as a way to fully cross-introduce the network with users from other networks; hope to integrate this further with StarkNet participants.</p><p>Past DAO/community involvements include: GenArt DAO, GCR Rebirth DAO, Klima DAO, and Gyroscope Protocol.</p><p>Most would probably categorize me as a community buildor first, then shippor next. But am now doing both with regards to StarkNet (doing the aforementioned omnichain NFT as a single team).</p><p>Additionally, I am committed to continuously educating myself and staying up-to-date with the latest developments in the field.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why Chas?</strong></p><p>As to why token-holders should delegate to me, I bring a combination of technical expertise, community engagement, and a deep understanding of the values that drive StarkNet. I am fully committed to the success of this project and will always put the interests of the network first.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Conflict of Interest</strong></p><p>There are no conflicts of interest for me.</p><p>Thanks so much for reading this. I welcome any questions or feedback from the community and am available to be reached on my deets above. I hope to have the opportunity to serve as a delegate and work together with the community to drive the success of StarkNet.</p><p>Again, Thanks!</p><p>Chas</p>",

    "statement": "<p>Hey everybody. This is Primitive from The Dope Wars. I’ve been involved in the Dope Dao for about a year. I’m very end user and community focused. Ideally I’d like to be as a bridge to connect the wider community to what’s happening in governance in a succinct and straightforward fashion. Details always matter, but brevity is also important in a busy world. One thing that sets me apart is I would have a much more active style of communication with those who delegate i.e. biweekly or monthly community calls to field questions and concerns, things to be clarified.</p><p><br></p><p>As DevinMat noted, decisions can come down to subjectivity. Even when it comes to maintaining and bolstering Ethereum’s core principles of decentralization, transparency, inclusivity and security. These are what would factor into every decision. With that, I would devote time to hearing in depth discussions by those in developing the ecosystem and what their thoughts are on changes, updates etc. I want to work in Starknet governance because it has the most novel system to reward developers I’ve found in the Ethereum ecosystem and that is important to me. I also think it is the most robust to guard it’s core principles and scale.</p><p><br></p><p>I’m a student of psychology and look to increase my understanding of group dynamics, especially those found in DAOs through resources being developed and evolving in this area of study. Participating in governance, proposal making, research, and creating user guides has been a great experience. All through the ups and downs. I hope to spread that passion and create high engagement in governance with the wider community. And help them understand key points so they can be informed voters.</p><p><br></p><p>Along with Slasher /Butterbum on Optimism, I hope to represent Dope Dao on Starknet. Along with research experience, Slasher’s guidance, and the experiences we’ve gone through at Dope Dao, I believe I can fulfill my intent to help build a strong community governance at Starknet.</p><p>Possible conflicts of interests- Dope Wars received 5k in Eth (at the time) in 2021 from Starknet. Dope Wars where I am active also received an Optimism grant. I don’t forsee Dope Wars seeking a future grant from Starknet for our minigame on Starknet within our Optimism MMO, or any other grants.</p><p><br></p><p>StarknetAddress: 0x036E9eb4fb651d1ab02Ef1A6BA91466b4c4a87090dE2BC65a929DA317eEFB026</p>",

    "statement": "<p>Heya! I am Swapnil Raj, the technical lead for the StarkNet group at Nethermind. I have been working on tooling and solutions for StarkNet for more than a year, and I have led the development of Warp - Solidity to Cairo transpiler, Voyager, the first block explorer for StarkNet, Juno - decentralization client, Aave aTokens bridge for StarkNet and UniStark - Uniswap transpiled to Cairo.</p><p><br></p><p>I have spoken about STARK proofs and StarkNet tooling at various Ethereum conferences and StarkNetCC. I am constantly talking to protocol specialists, researchers, wallet providers and builders, learning and contributing to as many parts of the network as I can!</p><p>Within the blockchain ecosystem, my specific interests include language design, cryptography and consensus.</p><p><br></p><p>I enjoy keeping up with and participating in the novel work within the StarkNet community, so I want to partake in the decision-making on the cutting edge of this field. My work has touched all parts of the network and has led me to become familiar with active problems - decentralization, gas metering, for instance - so I can make well-informed decisions about future votes for StarkNet. The current priority for StarkNet is decentralization, and I am participating in it through my work on Juno. Once that goal is reached, the next frontier will be seeing how StarkNet fits into the modular blockchain space. I have already involved myself in discussions surrounding Data Availability and mapping out how StarkNet integrates with custom DA solutions. This is the kind of innovative thinking I plan to bring to my role as a delegate.</p><p>While I am a technologist and love the challenges of our space, I believe that StarkNet’s value resides beyond its technological innovations. Therefore my decisions will be motivated by the ideals of decentralization, transparency and accessibility.</p><p><br></p><p>My work with Juno has been driven by my desire to decentralize StarkNet; this will be reflected in my decision-making. I will ensure the transparency of my work towards StarkNet by consistently engaging in public forums and clearly setting out my reasoning to involve everyone. I also value access and will take the opportunity to make technical aspects approachable to all community members. In fact, I am working with interns at Nethermind to make educational tooling around polynomial commitments.</p><p><br></p><p>I want to help grow StarkNet into being the leading rollup and bring permissionless access to everyone. You can be confident that my vote on each matter will always be guided by the decentralization and permissionless ethos.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Conflicts of Interest:</strong></p><p>I am an employee at Nethermind. As a delegate, I do not represent Nethermind. I will focus only on the growth of the ecosystem and the sustainable development of its secure tech. I see Nethermind’s and StarkNet’s goals as aligned: the decentralization and security of the network. In instances where Nethermind stands to gain directly from a proposal, I will abstain. In these cases, I will publicly state as such on the forum, and the Token Holders may choose to delegate elsewhere.</p>",

    "statement": "<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3><p>Hello there !</p><p><br></p><p>I am Bouchut, a French blockchain engineer and have been in the crypto-space since the end of 2017.</p><p><br></p><p>I started with Bitcoin mining in my student’s room, then I mined on other chains, ran masternodes, experimented with DeFi when it skyrocketed, traded NFTs, developed smart contracts and wrote a few articles on these subjects. As a software engineer, I’m approaching all these topics from a technical point of view and by digging every day deeper to see how protocols actually work.</p><p><br></p><p>Concerning Starknet, I was already convinced at the end of 2021 of the interest and the imminent expansion of layer 2s. I then followed the topic during 2022 while participating in the testnets and the experiments of several projects (nodes, wallets, dApp, bridges). Moreover, I explored the different types of layer 2s that are actively being developed (Optimistic Rollups, Zk Rollups, Zk EVM).</p><p>I am convinced that layer 2s are the future of programmable blockchain’s scalability. I am also convinced of a near future where different layer 2s would coexist (dedicated layers for application like Sorare or Immutable X, privacy focused or zk EVM ones, etc.).</p><p>As a developer, I have already started to dig into the technical functioning of Starknet and developed some projects in Cairo. I have for example done a lot of research on Account Abstraction (which is natively allowed by Starknet) and developed a multisig with improved governance rules. You can access the code and an article written on the subject here: <a href=\"https://techstories.blockchainpartner.fr/posts/starknet_multisig\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Starknet multisig article 2</a></p><p>Besides, I am a member of the Starknet community since the beginning. I attended all the French meetups of the year as well as the first edition of StarknetCC in Paris.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>My view on the Starknet governance</strong></h3><p>Today, as you all know, the decentralization of all layer 2s is really minimal. At the moment, only a few entities take care of the core infrastructure elements that constitute the rollups (sequencer, prover, verifier, fraud proof, zk-proof, bridge), the code is not open source and the evolution of the protocols is decided by the teams behind it. Starknet is not an exception to the rule and I hope that thanks to this governance system, we will be able to make the right decisions to improve the security of the network, its resilience and thus make the chain evolve in the right direction to attract even more capital that, for the moment, remains on Ethereum for security reasons.]</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Skills and area of expertise</strong></h3><p>Concerning my skillset, I’m mainly a blockchain developer specialized in smart contracts development (Solidity, Cairo) with some frontend (React, Typescript, Tailwind) to add a nice GUI to my projects, but I also run blockchain nodes (Ethereum, Starknet) and explore other technical elements (Account Abstraction, private key security, NFT’s metadata management, running a Chainlink node recently). I also love doing on-chain analysis.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Potential conflicts of interest</strong></h3><p>I work in the Crypto Advisory team of a Big Four firm where the main values are integrity and being impartial in all our decisions. So I have no conflicts of interest as a future delegate.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Requests of Delegators</strong></h3><p>If you have any requests, I would be happy to discuss them. Let’s make the best decisions for Starknet !</p>",

Our idea is to deploy on StarkNet in order to develop the community and social aspect on StarkNet. About my contributions to StarkNet, they boil down to the StarkNet France initiative launched in March 2022 with the help of 5 volunteers to translate StarkWare’s content into French. I also wrote some introductory articles to StarkNet and co-organized a meetup with Ethereum France. My current personal research focuses on Ethereum scaling, Token Engineering, Learning and SQL and UX web3. As a delegate, I promise that my decisions for the ecosystem will be made with holism approach and listening carefully for feedback from users for the proper development of the StarkNet ecosystem.",

In the governance, there are also many users wants to make the biggest profit in a short term. I will always consider if a proposal is beneficial to the long term vision and value of Starknet</li><li>Participation of the community: nowadays, many projects calls themselves DAO, but every time when it comes to the vote, only less than 10% token holders participates, so the result does not reflect the most users’ opinion. I will look at the participation rate, and explain the proposal to other users and encourage them to participate</li></ol><p><br></p><p>Past experience in DAO governance:</p><p>I have rich experience in DAO governance. I have actively participated in many projects such as AAVE, ENS, Lido, APE, DYDX, and Optimism. I’m familiar with Defi, NFTs and other L1 or L2 chains</p><p><br></p><p>Skills:</p><p>I’m a influencer in Chinese social platform- Weibo. I have 10k blockchain followers, and I have posted many news and educated my followers about Starkware many times.</p><p><br></p><p>People can believe me and delegate to me as I have discussed with my followers about different blockchains a lot, so I have gained rich experience. I can participate in Starknet governance respectfully and spread starknet to more Asian users</p><p><br></p><p>I have no potential conflicts of interest with your participation in StarkNet governance as a delegate.</p>",

My personal values are the following: Allow Starknet to grow organically and achieve a mature phase by continuously looking back at Starkware’s roadmap. I like Starknet because it doesn’t cut corners to quickly achieve a finished product. Starkware believes in the power of STARKs and its benefits and comes back to these values to remind everyone that Starknet is a serious game that is here to stay.</p><p><br></p><p>Thank you.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

We actively participate in governance on Uniswap, AAVE, Compound, dYdX and Optimism, and are expanding our governance focus to more protocols. We have a track record of creating quality proposals and actively voting on Uniswap, Aave, etc. We created proposal about lowering the minimum proposing threshold on Compound to increase equity and inclusivity for proposal creation (https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/89). Blockchain at Berkeley has departments including consulting for leading web3 projects, blockchain education on edX, blockchain accelerator program, and research. Our governance department is in charge of protocol research and voting for StarkNet protocol. We dedicate at least one lead to each protocol and include all governance member to make decisions on all proposals. The voting process within the department is democratic to balance knowledge from seasoned members and thoughts from younger members.",

Before that, I worked in the research and development team for&nbsp;<strong>Pangolin dex</strong>, a decentralized exchange on Avalanche where I was able to tackle cross-chain communication (Near, Hedera, Flare, etc) and to understand better dexes architecture and their tokenomics by indexing data. I applied these skills acquired since my entry in the Starknet universe with&nbsp;<strong>Sithswap</strong>&nbsp;one of the most important and promising AMM of Starknet, for whom I worked for several months. This allowed me to actively contribute to the development of Starknet and specifically&nbsp;<strong>Checkpoint</strong>&nbsp;an indexing tool on Starknet from&nbsp;<strong>SnapshotLabs</strong>&nbsp;for which I’m now dev rel.

To attain effective governance, there must be efficient communication and cooperation, as well as a set of fair and clear regulations and procedures. Moreover, it is important to establish ways to resolve conflicts and handle any difficulties that may arise. By promoting a culture of transparency, engagement, inclusivity, and the right tooling. I am confident that we can establish a truly decentralized and efficient governance system that can attain its objectives.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Potential Conflicts of interest</strong></p><p>I am focused on Starknet since my entry to the ecosystem, I don’t have any potential conflicts of interests.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p><p>If you have any type of request don’t hesitate to reach me!</p><p>–</p><p>Antiyro</p><p><em>Let’s make Starknet functional, performant and decentralised!</em></p>",

I have recently been working a lot with Cairo 1 and produced a lot of content to help developers catch up with the language as fast as possible. I release a blog post that is the most up-to-date reference for Cairo 1 and developed a complete set of exercises on Starklings for developers to get started on Starknet.

The idea was to stake some Eth and appoint a third party to evaluate your progress on a task. And you lose your staked Eth forever if you procrastinated and didn’t complete the task within a time frame. I did a workshop on developing on-chain games in StarkNetCC Bangalore in December 2022 with Cairo 1. Also make been making some tiny contributions to it since November 2022. Other project I am working on include Starklings-Cairo1, Creative Cairo, Starknet Hardhat plugin, dojoengine/dojo, dojoengine/cairo, Pathfinder - WebSocket based event subscriptions, Shhtarknet and couple others. I don’t have any experience working with DAOs but have read about them a bit. Dev skills - Rust, Cairo, NodeJS, frontend. Some team management skills. Committed to StarkNet since 2022 with cool ideas for the platform; looking for deeper connection with the community; started learning HTML & web design 2007; freelancing 2012-18; digital nomad 2018-19; set up company 2019; stopped taking new clients 2021; asked to teach Software Developer Immersive at PaCE@NTU University 2021-22.",

Since then, I’ve never stopped learning new things about blockchain. Having the opportunity to contribute to the decentralisation of one of these technologies would be a great honour.

My recent posts can be found at https://starknetdigger.notion.site/starknetdigger/Starknet_Digger-b038024fc9924bf98dd61e7074903645 and on the Lens platform at https://lenster.xyz/u/starknet_digger. I managed Swagtimus' weekly newsletter for several months, which I now continue in my own name every Monday (https://starknetroundup.substack.com). Additionally, my Substack research account (https://starknetresearch.substack.com) offers complete project presentations or narrative articles related to the StarkNet ecosystem, published monthly at minimum; and a community Discord server has been launched with three other StarkNet OGs (https://discord.gg/4MmAsm5XRq). As a delegate, I will prioritize the overall interests of the community, listening to their needs and responding accordingly through discussion spaces such as our Discord server and on Twitter @Starket_OG; while also being willing to go against the opinion of strong ecosystem members in favor of what our community wants when needed - all this while pursuing only the interests of our community . My experience in crypto since 2017 has allowed me to gain deep understanding of various DeFi mechanisms that are often considered complex from both a marketing and  community management point of view, capable of boiling concepts to their essential elements for easy summarization when necessary; as well as having supported some DeFi projects before becoming full-time dedicated to StarkNet since 2021 after graduating from university .",

I’ve found the approach Optimism took, in particular, to be an excellent way of stimulating engagement, feeding funds back into the ecosystem and creating a system whereby governance isn’t strictly plutocratic. Above all this is my main vision / hope for crypto - trying to avoid the antidemocratic centralization of wealth and power that already exists in the real world.

    "statement": "Determined to be a part of this exciting movement, I joined Screenshot Labs and immersed myself in the world of blockchain technology, particularly Ethereum and its principles. Over a year, we developed an intellectual property called Everai, which allowed us to identify various challenges and user requirements in the NFT industry. Based on this experience, we made the decision to create our latest product, The Ark Project, leveraging StarkNet technology to align with the decentralized approach. As a product designer, I am convinced that emerging technologies (cf. blockchain, AI...) will shape the products of tomorrow. With this conviction comes a responsibility to identify use cases that will benefit the widest possible audience. To accomplish this, we need to understand people’s needs and transform them into seamless experiences. The priority should be on adapting technologies to serve user needs instead of expecting users to adapt themselves  to technology. As a delegate and builder in the ecosystem I aim to share my knowledge and expertise in user experience as well as governance topics with StarkNet builders and users... My team and I are fully committed to playing an active role in developing this thriving community while contributing towards its success.",

I have 10 years of experience in design, during which I was fortunate enough to work for clients such as Louis Vuitton, Galeries Lafayette, RATP (Paris transportation system), Lancôme, La Tour d’Argent, Parmigiani Fleurier and the Élysée Palace. My personal interest in blockchain tech started around 2020 as an investor and defi user, and really took off a year later during the explosion of NFTs. I’m genuinely supportive of the concept of decentralisation, and strongly believe that the inherently censorship resistant aspect of blockchain is drastically changing the way we interact with digital products, and with each other. When I got to join Screenshot in October 2021 it was the perfect opportunity for me to use my skills to support an industry I truly believe in on a personal level. After developing the Everai IP over the past year, the countless pain points we and our users encountered when interacting with NFTs pushed us to start looking deeper into how we could contribute and pave way for better user experiences while always keeping our decentralization beliefs intact. We chose Starknet as our primary ecosystem we would like to build on -and couldn't be more excited- getting more involved into it! \nAs a delegate my aim is to lend my voice&insights so that help expand our ecosystem contributing to establish Starknet as an appealing platform choice for builders; aligning myself with values of building transparently &with best interest of users/builders in mind (The Ark Project will be openly sourced). We are actively working with other Starknet projects aiming at boosting its visibility & appeal within new actors searching their ideal infrastructure platform.- Joachim",
