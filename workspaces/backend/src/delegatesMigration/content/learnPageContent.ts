      '# Starknet’s journey towards decentralization\n' +
      'STARK technology is mature and secure, but Starknet has not achieved the status of a public good yet, such as Ethereum or the Internet. In order for Starknet to reach this goal, its operation and development must continue to be gradually decentralized.\n' +
      'Several processes are being advanced simultaneously in order to fulfill Starknet’s vision of becoming a censorship-resistant public network. Including:\n' +
      '- Development of the Starknet Decentralized Protocol (more details )\n' +
      '- Gradual implementation of the decision-making processes for protocol upgrades (Starknet Core Governance)\n' +
      '- Creating a broad, diverse, active and high-quality community of builders and users\n' +
      '- The establishment of a non-profit organization (Starknet Foundation) whose only purpose is to promote the long-term vision of Starknet.\n' +
      '- Building a diverse and robust complementary stack by different teams\n' +
      '- Sharing the source code of the network core components (more details here)\n' +
      '# Starknet Foundation\n' +
      'The Foundation is an independent, not-for-profit entity to advance the shared technology that is Starknet. It’s mission: To advance Starknet as a public good for all, and maintain it as such for years to come.\n' +
      'The Starknet Foundation will foster research and development of the Starknet network, ecosystem, and supporting technology, promote the adoption of the Starknet network, and fuel Starknet community participation.\n' +
      'One of the Foundation’s main priorities is furthering Starknet’s decentralization, including developing Starknet governance mechanisms.\n' +

      '# Overview\n' +
      'If you&#39;ve ever wondered how the wild west of the Internet - the land of decentralized protocols - manages to maintain some semblance of order, then you&#39;re in the right place. It&#39;s like stepping into a party where everyone has a say in the playlist, and the chaos that ensues is precisely what makes it a blast. Let&#39;s unravel this techno-mumbo-jumbo and understand how this crowd-managed circus, also known as decentralized governance, works.\n' +
      '# The big picture\n' +
      'Picture the regular world - you&#39;ve got governments, corporations, boards - entities with power who make decisions. In the decentralized world, it&#39;s like taking that power and throwing it into a crowd at a rock concert, hoping that they catch it and make decisions collaboratively. Scary? Maybe. Exciting? Definitely.\n' +
      'Protocols like Ethereum and StarkNet, at their core, operate on this principle. Everyone has a voice, or more accurately, a vote. The many manage themselves without the need for the few.\n' +
      '# The power brokers\n' +
      'So, who holds the reins in this brave new world? The answer is not as straightforward as you might think. It&#39;s a vibrant mix of token holders, developers, and miners. If you own tokens, contribute code, or mine blocks, congratulations - you&#39;re part of the decision-making process.\n' +
      '# The Art of Decision-Making\n' +
      'How does this crowd arrive at a consensus, you ask? Well, think of it as a gigantic, global town-hall meeting. Proposed changes, called &quot;proposals,&quot; are brought up, and the crowd votes. And just like in the real world, sometimes people can&#39;t agree, which leads to a &quot;fork&quot; - essentially a breakup where a part of the crowd creates a new protocol following their own rules.\n',

      '# Starknet’s progressive governance\n' +
      'A decentralized network that strives to evolve over time needs to have progressively evolving decentralized governance mechanisms to support protocol upgrades.\n' +
      'These mechanisms should focus on enabling necessary changes in a decentralized, secure, and efficient manner. They should include checks and balances, and have a voting system that takes into account professional expertise, reputation and commitment to the network’s vision and values.\n' +
      'Bootstrapping quality governance mechanisms that enable an open community to manage protocol upgrades is a serious challenge. It is a gradual, exploratory, and sensitive process that requires broad community collaboration, with ongoing adjustments to the characteristics of the network. These characteristics include the network’s maturity, the frequency of required upgrades, the breadth of the community, the level of decentralization of the various elements, and more.\n' +
      'L2&#39;s in general, and Starknet specifically, have special characteristics that require the construction of a unique governance system that combines elements of on-chain governance, such as in the application layer in the case of DAOs, with off-chain governance, similar to that of an L1 blockchain such as Ethereum.\n' +
      'In order to plan and orchestrate the initial phases of Starknet’s governance mechanisms, the Starknet Foundation established the Governance Committee. The committee is responsible for the gradual construction of the Starknet protocol’s governance system, to realize Starknet’s long-term vision.\n' +
      'Taking this into account, we are implementing governance mechanisms in phases. Each phase contains changes based on learnings from previous phases, the growth of the network ecosystem, and progress towards decentralization.\n' +
      'This section contains the details for the current phase. Everyone is invited to take part in the discussions on formulating the next steps.\n',
