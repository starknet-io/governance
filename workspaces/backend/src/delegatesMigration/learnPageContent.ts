      "If you've ever wondered how the wild west of the Internet - the land of decentralized protocols - manages to maintain some semblance of order, then you're in the right place. It's like stepping into a party where everyone has a say in the playlist, and the chaos that ensues is precisely what makes it a blast. Let's unravel this techno-mumbo-jumbo and understand how this crowd-managed circus, also known as decentralized governance, works.\n\n # The big picture\n" +
      "Picture the regular world - you've got governments, corporations, boards - entities with power who make decisions. In the decentralized world, it's like taking that power and throwing it into a crowd at a rock concert, hoping that they catch it and make decisions collaboratively. Scary? Maybe. Exciting? Definitely.\n" +

      "So, who holds the reins in this brave new world? The answer is not as straightforward as you might think. It's a vibrant mix of token holders, developers, and miners. If you own tokens, contribute code, or mine blocks, congratulations - you're part of the decision-making process.\n\n # The Art of Decision-Making\n" +
      'How does this crowd arrive at a consensus, you ask? Well, think of it as a gigantic, global town-hall meeting. Proposed changes, called "proposals," are brought up, and the crowd votes. And just like in the real world, sometimes people can\'t agree, which leads to a "fork" - essentially a breakup where a part of the crowd creates a new protocol following their own rules.',

      'It will be seen that this mere painstaking burrower and grub-worm of a poor devil of a Sub-Sub appears to have gone through the long Vaticans and street-stalls of the earth, picking up whatever random allusions to whales he could anyways find in any book whatsoever, sacred or profane.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Therefore you must not, in every case at least, take the higgledy-piggledy whale statements, however authentic, in these extracts, for veritable gospel cetology. Far from it. As touching the ancient authors generally, as well as the poets here appearing, these extracts are solely valuable or entertaining, as affording a glancing bird’s eye view of what has been promiscuously said, thought, fancied, and sung of Leviathan, by many nations and generations, including our own.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'So fare thee well, poor devil of a Sub-Sub, whose commentator I am. Thou belongest to that hopeless, sallow tribe which no wine of this world will ever warm; and for whom even Pale Sherry would be too rosy-strong; but with whom one sometimes loves to sit, and feel poor-devilish, too; and grow convivial upon tears; and say to them bluntly, with full eyes and empty glasses, and in not altogether unpleasant sadness—Give it up, Sub-Subs! For by how much the more pains ye take to please the world, by so much the more shall ye for ever go thankless! Would that I could clear out Hampton Court and the Tuileries for ye! But gulp down your tears and hie aloft to the royal-mast with your hearts; for your friends who have gone before are clearing out the seven-storied heavens, and making refugees of long-pampered Gabriel, Michael, and Raphael, against your coming. Here ye strike but splintered hearts together—there, ye shall strike unsplinterable glasses!',
